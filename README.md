# Grafana k6 Performance Testing Framework

A modular, cloud-ready, and chaos-tolerant performance testing framework built with [K6](https://k6.io) for distributed systems and microservices at scale. This framework is designed to simulate 100k+ concurrent users across multiple regions and services.

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### 🔧 1. Local Run

> Simulates load from your machine using K6 OSS

```bash

k6 run tests/example.test.js

```
> Custom Env. variable, Virtual Users (VUs), & Duration:

```bash

ENV=prod DURATION=5m VUS=500 k6 run tests/example.test.js

```

### ☁️ 2. K6 Cloud (Distributed Test)
> Run globally distributed tests with real-time dashboards

```bash

k6 cloud tests/example.test.js

```
> Make sure your options include:

```js
export const options = {
  cloud: {
    name: "Load Test Auth Service",
    projectID: YOUR_PROJECT_ID,
    distribution: {
      au_sydney: { loadZone: 'amazon:au:sydney', percent: 50 },
      us_east: { loadZone: 'amazon:us:ashburn', percent: 50 }
    }
  }
};

```

### ☸️ 3. Kubernetes via k6-operator (for massive distributed testing)

> Install the K6 Operator: macOS (Using Homebrew)
```bash

brew install kubectl
```
```bash

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator/releases/latest/download/k6-operator.yaml

```
> Create a K6 custom resource:

```yml

apiVersion: k6.io/v1alpha1
kind: K6
metadata:
  name: checkout-test
spec:
  parallelism: 10
  script:
    configMap:
      name: checkout-test
      file: checkout.test.js
```
> 📈 How to Scale
> 
➕ Add New Service Test
1. Create tests/<service>.test.js

2. Create a scenario in config.js or your test runner

3. Update thresholds in /docs/thresholds.md

4. Tag your metrics: tags: { service: '<name>' }

> 📊 Ramp Load
> 
> Configure VUs and duration in your scenario

```js
export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    spike_checkout: {
      executor: 'ramping-arrival-rate',
      stages: [
        { target: 2000, duration: '30s' },
        { target: 8000, duration: '1m' },
        { target: 1000, duration: '30s' }
      ]
    }
  }
};
```
> Important thresholds
> 
✅ **http_req_duration**: Measures overall API response time performance.  
✅ **http_req_waiting (TTFB)**: Tracks the time to first byte, indicating server response delays.  
✅ **http_req_receiving**: Measures how fast the response data is received after processing.  
✅ **http_req_sending**: Tracks how quickly the request is sent to the server.  
✅ **http_reqs**: Ensures the test is generating a sufficient number of API requests.  
✅ **vus**: Ensures the correct number of virtual users (VUs) are active during the test.  
✅ **iterations**: Ensures enough test cycles complete successfully to validate system behavior.  
✅ **http_req_failed**: Helps track API failure rates and ensures reliability.  
✅ **checks**: Ensures a high percentage of validation checks pass during the test.  
✅ **http_req_duration{status:200}**: Monitors response time for successful (200 OK) requests.  
✅ **http_req_duration{status:400}**: Tracks response times for client-side errors (400 series).  
✅ **http_req_duration{status:500}**: Monitors backend server issues and response times for 500 errors.

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration
✅ GitHub Actions (Example)

```yml
jobs:
  performance-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run K6 Cloud Tests
        run: k6 cloud tests/auth.test.js
        env:
          K6_CLOUD_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.K6_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

---
## 🔍 Observability: Grafana + InfluxDB
✅ Setup InfluxDB Output

```bash

k6 run --out influxdb=http://localhost:8086/k6 tests/auth.test.js

```
✅ Grafana Dashboard

Use official K6 Grafana Dashboard or build custom dashboards with metrics:

* Requests/sec
* Response Time (p95)
* Error Rate
* VUs & Iterations
* Tags by service / region
