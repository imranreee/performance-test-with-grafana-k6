## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### 🔧 1. Local Run

> Simulates load from your machine using K6 OSS

```bash

k6 run tests/example.test.js

```
> Custom Env. variable, Virtual Users (VUs), & Duration:

```bash

ENV=prod DURATION=5m VUS=500 k6 run tests/example.test.js

```

### ☁️ 2. K6 Cloud (Distributed Test)


> 1. Generate a token, by follow these steps:

* Log in to your Grafana Cloud [account](https://app.k6.io/) and open a stack.
* On the main menu, click Testing & synthetics -> Performance -> Settings.
* Click on the Grafana Stack API token tab.

> 2. Authenticate with the login command:

```bash 

k6 cloud login --token $TOKEN
```
> 
> Run globally distributed tests with real-time dashboards

```bash

k6 cloud tests/example.test.js

```
> Run a test locally and stream the results to the cloud
```bash

k6 cloud run --local-execution cloud_demo.js

```
> Run a CLI test in a specific project and custom env variables

```bash

K6_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=PROJECT_ID ENV=dev DURATION=5m VUS=500 k6 run tests/example.test.js

```

> Make sure your options include:

```js
export const options = {
  cloud: {
    name: "Load Test Auth Service",
    projectID: YOUR_PROJECT_ID,
    distribution: {
      au_sydney: { loadZone: 'amazon:au:sydney', percent: 50 },
      us_east: { loadZone: 'amazon:us:ashburn', percent: 50 }
    }
  }
};

```

### ☸️ 3. Kubernetes via k6-operator (for massive distributed testing)

> Install the K6 Operator: macOS (Using Homebrew)
```bash

brew install kubectl
```
```bash

kubectl apply -f /path/to/k6-testrun-resource.yaml

```
> Create a K6 custom resource:

```yml

apiVersion: k6.io/v1alpha1
kind: K6
metadata:
  name: checkout-test
spec:
  parallelism: 10
  script:
    configMap:
      name: checkout-test
      file: checkout.test.js
```

## 📈 How to Scale

➕ Add New Service Test
1. Create tests/<service>.test.js

2. Create a scenario in config.js or your test runner

3. Update thresholds in /docs/thresholds.md

4. Tag your metrics: tags: { service: '<name>' }

> 📊 Ramp Load
> 
> Configure VUs and duration in your scenario

```js
export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    spike_checkout: {
      executor: 'ramping-arrival-rate',
      stages: [
        { target: 2000, duration: '30s' },
        { target: 8000, duration: '1m' },
        { target: 1000, duration: '30s' }
      ]
    }
  }
};
```
> Configure thresholds
> 
✅ http_req_duration: Measures overall API response time performance.  
✅ http_req_waiting (TTFB): Tracks the time to first byte, indicating server response delays.  
✅ http_req_receiving: Measures how fast the response data is received after processing.  
✅ http_req_sending: Tracks how quickly the request is sent to the server.  
✅ http_reqs: Ensures the test is generating a sufficient number of API requests.  
✅ vus: Ensures the correct number of virtual users (VUs) are active during the test.  
✅ iterations: Ensures enough test cycles complete successfully to validate system behavior.  
✅ http_req_failed: Helps track API failure rates and ensures reliability.  
✅ checks: Ensures a high percentage of validation checks pass during the test.  
✅ http_req_duration{status:200}: Monitors response time for successful (200 OK) requests.  
✅ http_req_duration{status:400}: Tracks response times for client-side errors (400 series).  
✅ http_req_duration{status:500}: Monitors backend server issues and response times for 500 errors.

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration
✅ GitHub Actions (Example)

```yml
jobs:
  performance-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run K6 Cloud Tests
        run: k6 cloud tests/auth.test.js
        env:
          K6_CLOUD_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.K6_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

---

## 🔍 Observability: Grafana + InfluxDB
✅ Setup InfluxDB Output

```bash

k6 run --out influxdb=http://localhost:8086/k6 tests/auth.test.js

```
✅ Grafana Dashboard

Use official K6 Grafana Dashboard or build custom dashboards with metrics:

* Requests/sec
* Response Time (p95)
* Error Rate
* VUs & Iterations
* Tags by service / region

## Future Scope

### Scaling from 5 to 20+ Services
1. Modularize Tests:
Keep test scripts for each service separate. Import common functions or configurations (e.g., URLs, tokens) to avoid redundancy.

2. Configuration Management:
Use a centralized config file for global settings shared across services.

3. Service-Specific Tests:
Write individual test cases for each service or module to avoid overlap.

4. Distributed Testing:

    * Use k6 Cloud for cloud scaling.

    * Use Docker or Kubernetes for local, distributed testing (multiple containers running tests).

### Distributed Test Execution (100k+ Users)
1. k6 Cloud:
For scaling to 100k+ users, use k6 Cloud for automatic scaling and distributed load generation.

2. Docker-based Setup:
   * Use Docker containers for distributed execution.
   * Run tests across multiple nodes (machines/containers) for load distribution.

3. Clustered Execution:
Use a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across services during tests.

### Separation of Concerns
1. Test Logic:
Keep test logic in separate functions and scripts for better organization.

2. Setup/Teardown:
Use setup() and teardown() functions to separate test preparation and cleanup.

3. Data Management:
Store test data in separate files (JSON/CSV) and load them dynamically during tests.

4. Reporting:
Output results to InfluxDB or Prometheus, and visualize in Grafana.

### Auto-Generate Performance Reports
1. Track Custom Metrics:
Use k6’s custom metrics (e.g., response times, throughput) for each service.

2. Send Data to Grafana:
Use the k6 --out influxdb option to send test data to InfluxDB for visualization.

3. Grafana Dashboards:
Create a dashboard per service to track key metrics like response time, errors, and throughput.

4. Automate Reports:
Use Grafana to export dashboards as PDFs or set up alerts for performance thresholds.
